The Program will print "In SuperClass" infinitely until a stackOverflow occurs. This is due to
the SuperClass calling the Child Class Constructor within its own constructor. Since the child class
also will automatically invoke the Parent constructor (before its own creation), this will result in an infinite loop -
because of the infinite loop and Stackoverflow, a Child class object will never get created.
